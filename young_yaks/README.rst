Young Yaks' project
===================

| You're a cow farmer just relaxing and reading the newspaper when you see an interesting article.
| "NASA thinks aliens will invade earth!", you put down your newspaper.
| What about your cows?!? You get an ingenious idea! Who would wanna come to a dead planet?
| And so, your journey begins. Your journey as a cow farmer killing earth.
